# Optional Roadmap: MagicaVoxel Interop

## Phase 2: `.vox` Import and Export

- Implement `.vox` writer for a single model.
- Include `SIZE`, `XYZI`, and `RGBA` chunks.
- Keep materials simple and ignore advanced chunks initially.

## Notes

- `.vxm` remains the primary internal format.
- `.vox` support is for interoperability only.
